# San Antonio Animal-Adoptions 
The purpose of this project was to look at he demographic information related to adopted and adoptable dogs in shelters within a 150-mile radius of San Antonio, between January and November 2020. Using APIs obtained from Petfinder.com and a pre-existing data set found on Kaggle, we were able to put together a data set showing adoption information for 7474 dogs across 123 animal shelters. With the addition of the petpy library for python, we were able to write scripts to answer the following questions: 
  -  How many animal shelters are within 150-mile radius of San Antonio?
  -  How many dogs were in these shelters between January and November 2020?
  -  Out of the total number of dogs, how many were adopted during this time? How many dogs are still adoptable as of November 2020?
  -  For the total number of dogs and adopted/adoptable comparisons in these shelters:
      - What were the top five breeds of adopted/adoptable dogs?
      - What was the gender breakdown of adopted/adoptable dogs?
      - What were the size groupings of the adopted/adoptable dogs?
      - What were the age groupings of the adopted/adoptable dogs? 
      - What percentage of the adopted/adoptable dogs were spayed/neutered?
      - What percentage of the adopted/adoptable dogs were vaccinated?
  -  Which shelter in the 150-mile radius has the most dogs?
  -  How do the demographics of the largest shelter compare to the overall shelter population?
